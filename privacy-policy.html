        with our Site, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal
        of any infringing materials and for the termination of users of our online Site who are repeated infringers of
        intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of
        our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material
        removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must
        be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:

      <ul>
        <li>
          your physical or electronic signature;
        </li>
        <li>
          identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;
        </li>
        <li>
          identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;

          address;

        <li>
          a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are

          behalf of the copyright owner.
        </li>

      <p>
        Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact in a written
        notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s
        fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.
