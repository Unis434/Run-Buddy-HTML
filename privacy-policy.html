        with our Site, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal
        of any infringing materials and for the termination of users of our online Site who are repeated infringers of
        intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of
        our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material
        removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must
        be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:
