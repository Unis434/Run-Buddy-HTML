        <strong>Endurance, or aerobic,</strong> activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and biking.
        <br>
        <strong> Strength, or resistance training, exercises</strong> make your muscles stronger. Some examples are lifting weights and using a resistance band.
        <br>
        <strong> Balance exercises</strong> can make it easier to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls. To improve your balance, try tai chi or exercises like standing on one leg.
        <br>
        <strong> Flexibility exercises</strong> stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Yoga and doing various stretches can make you more flexible.
